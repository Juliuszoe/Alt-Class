      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Evuarere Zoe Ohwoghere, and I'm on a thrilling journey at
        the crossroads of technology and business. I call Delta State, Nigeria,
        my home, and my story is just beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I honed my skills and earned my stripes at Delta State Polytechnic Otefe
        Oghara, majoring in Computer Engineering. The world of circuits and
        codes fascinated me, and I graduated with a hunger to unravel more.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not deciphering lines of code, you'll catch me envisioning
        business strategies. I'm not just generating code; I'm generating
        interest and excitement for the potential of tech to transform the way
        we do business.
        <br />
        Oh, and did I mention my love for capturing moments? Behind the lens, I
        find another canvas to blend technology and art, showcasing a world
        where pixels and creativity dance in harmony.
        <br />
        This is just the beginning. My journey is fueled by curiosity and a
        relentless passion for the dynamic dance between tech and business. Stay
        tuned because there's more innovation and excitement to come!
      </p>
